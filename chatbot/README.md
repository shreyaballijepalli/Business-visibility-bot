**WORK IN PROGRESS**

A chatbot with conversation and personalization using IBM API.

You can run the application using the command: node app

The database is empty. So initially for logging in you need to register yourselves first.
You can login after registering.

Once you login, you will be directed to the chatbot.Presently the chatbot can give answers to only a few questions.This is because I haven't yet stored the data in a database and calculated the result.

You can ask questions like 
How many new unique parent requests we got for Customer01?
What is the Average time spent for open PERs for Customer01?


I am currently working on the database part and will update the app in 5-6 days.
